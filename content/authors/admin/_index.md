I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu) 
at the [University of California, San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu). 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nadia Polikarpova](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova), 
and be a member of [Programming Systems group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/).


I am interested in using Programming Languages techniques to automate programming tasks. 
Currently, my focus is on program synthesis tools, 
which generate programs from high-level specifications. 
My goal is to enable the synthesis to scale to real-world tasks and 
to infer human intentions from limited information.
